# PenguinsFish_Android
Android port of my game "Puffguins and Fish," originally released on PC. ​Based on the children’s board game, “Hey! That's My Fish!”, 
“Puffguins” originated as the final project in my advanced game programming class before I graduated with my degree in Game Development 
at Golden West College. Although the purpose of this project was advanced programming concepts, after graduation I created custom 
assets for the game (the “Puffguins”) in order to personalize the project and to demonstrate my skills in “right-brained” 
asset creation, as well as “left-brained” coding and scripting.
